I didn't have access to our main repository (for some reason- maybe because we created it in an organization and didn't realize only one of us had permissions?) so I forked the repository at the last minute and submitted it on my own (Becky McConnell's) account.
I hope you can see the milestone and see that it was pushed on time. I would've pushed to our real repository, but unfortunately it seems like the owner was asleep or not paying attention to slack. 
So, yeah. I'm sorry if forking the repo caused any inconvenience to you guys.

update: I got access to the original repo and pushed the milestone and this (along with what Iâ€™ve been working on this week) there.
