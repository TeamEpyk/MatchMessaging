Team name: Team Epyk

Member: Becky McConnell, Danny Nguyen, Taylore Prinsen, Kyle Rosenberg, Gaojian Song, and Jie Wang.

Description:  Our project is a web-based chat room. Users can choose to enter different chat rooms based on their personal interests. For example, if a user is interested in movies, they could enter a chat room for those who are interested in movies. Users can also create their own rooms and wait for users with similar hobbies to join. Our goal is for users to be able to meet new people and friends. 
    We will allow users to create profiles and select interests for others to view. We will also devise an algorithm that will periodically recommend other users who have selected similar interests to allow people to find friends. 

Vision statement: Our goal is to make this world a better place by bringing like-minded people together. 

Motivation: We’ve all felt loneliness, and wished we could interact with more people. We believe that by creating a website that connects people with similar interests, we can combat this loneliness, so people can feel more confident and happy in life. This app also allows users to share their ideas with like-minded people, so they can share their thoughts about various topics and feel like they have been heard.

Risk: Our project will not be extremely difficult to implement - we have chosen something that will push us as a team but not strain us due to our previous abilities with website development. Some risks that could be incurred throughout our development process include lack of communication, disagreement on project ideas, and poor time management. We haven’t yet learned interface, network protocol, or how to build a bridge between frontend and backend, so there is also a risk for failing to complete this project if we fail to efficiently and effectively learn these required skills.

Risk Mitigation Plan: Because we have chosen a highly doable project for our team, there are not too many risks to mitigate. With both individual and group learning and collaborating, we believe we can reach our goal with few problems. To mitigate our risks, it will be important for us to be actively communicating - sharing our true opinions and beliefs on the topic (with flexibility and understanding the needs and feelings of the others in the group), as well as spending enough time learning the required concepts and platforms to complete our project. There are also some examples that show how to develop a chat room available on the internet - we can use the internet as a vital tool to help create this application. As far as time management goes, it will also be vital to our success as a team to continuously create and stay on top of milestones and due dates - we need to make sure that not only individually, but as a team, we don’t fall behind.

Version Control: The main method of version control that our team will use is GitHub. GitHub offers easy access to project repositories which will be useful for our chat room idea since many people will be able to collaborate and work on something that is current and up to date. The link to the repository is: https://github.com/TeamEpyk/MatchMessaging

Development Method: The development method that our team decided to use was Agile Development which follows a cycle of reviewing the requirements, coming up with ideas for design, developing those ideas, testing the developed product, deploying that  product, reviewing its results and repeating. We believe this method to be the most effective for our team.

Collaboration Tool: The collaboration tool that our team decided to use was Slack, which is offered through a web browser and phone application. We will also use Skype for voice calls when needed.

Proposed Architecture: The backend of our project will be created in C++, Python, or SQL, depending on which fits our needs best, and will likely run in a free tier Google Compute Engine server. The frontend will be created for three different platforms (Desktop, Mobile, and Web) using various javascript frameworks such as electron, node, and meteor. The backend will be the database and other information-processing code, and the frontend will have the user interface and accept input. The frontend and backend will communicate using socket programming for the mobile and desktop apps, and SSL for the web app, likely formatted using the standard JSON.
